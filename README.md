### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Himel

I'm a passionate MERN Stake Web Developer. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. I love coding. I'm currently an Information Science student at Noakhali Science and Technology University. When I'm not on my study or coding, you'll find me reading books, or watching movies.
